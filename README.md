# Reminders

Welcome to the 'reminders' project. This started as a tool to help automate sending email based on data in an Excel spreadsheet for my wife. Since I'm not a Visual Basic programmer and don't even have Excel installed on my computer, I reached for Python to help.

## Usage

** TODO: **
* Describe how to use this
* Provide an example
* Write tests
* Create a Docker container

## Contributing

This is an open source project, and I hope you find some utililty in this program (or at least some of the code examples). I would be happy to accept contributions to improve this so others may find it useful, too.
